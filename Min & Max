  1) Supose that in an array we want to find for each element the closest value to the left / right that is bigger / smaller than our current element. How do we proceed?
Well, we can just create a stack and at each element we pop elements from the stack until we find the one that satisfy our conditions, then we insert our current element 
continue the process. This way, each array element is inserted and deleted at most once, this give us a time complexity of O(n).
